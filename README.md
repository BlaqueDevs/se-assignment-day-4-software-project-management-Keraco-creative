## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology
Advantages:
1. Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows for changes in project requirements, even late in development. This adaptability is particularly useful in projects where requirements are uncertain or evolving.
2. Customer Collaboration: Agile encourages regular interaction with customers and stakeholders. This ongoing feedback loop ensures that the project is aligned with customer needs and expectations.
3. Faster Delivery: Agile promotes incremental development and frequent delivery of smaller, functional parts of the software. This leads to faster deployment of a minimum viable product (MVP) and quicker realization of value.
4. Improved Quality: Continuous testing and integration in Agile methodologies lead to early detection and resolution of defects, improving the overall quality of the software.
   Disadvantages:
   1. Less Predictable: Due to its flexible nature, Agile can be less predictable in terms of time and cost. Projects may not have a clear end date or budget, which can be challenging for stakeholders who prefer fixed timelines and budgets.
   2. Requires Skilled Teams: Agile requires teams to be highly skilled, self-organizing, and capable of managing themselves. If team members are not experienced, the project may suffer from lack of direction and discipline.
   3. Potential for Scope Creep: The iterative nature of Agile can lead to scope creep if the project is not well-managed. Constant changes and additions to the project can extend timelines and increase costs.
   4. Documentation Can Be Lacking: Agile focuses more on working software than comprehensive documentation, which can lead to insufficient documentation. This can be problematic for future maintenance or onboarding new team members.
      Waterfall Methodology
      Advantages:
      1. Clear Structure and Documentation: Waterfall provides a clear, structured approach with defined phases and milestones. This makes it easier to understand, manage, and document the project from start to finish.
      2. Easy to Manage: The linear nature of Waterfall makes it easier to manage and control. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process, providing a clear project roadmap.
      3. Predictability: Waterfall is highly predictable in terms of timelines and costs, as each phase is planned in advance. This predictability is useful for stakeholders who prefer a fixed timeline and budget.
      4. Good for Well-Defined Projects: Waterfall is well-suited for projects where requirements are clearly defined, and there is little expectation of changes. This approach works well in industries where change is costly or risky.
         Disadvantages:
         1. Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed in Waterfall, it is challenging to go back and make changes. This rigidity makes it less adaptable to changing requirements or unforeseen issues.
         2. Delayed Testing: Testing in Waterfall is typically done at the end of the development cycle, which can lead to the discovery of defects and issues late in the process. Fixing these issues can be costly and time-consuming.
         3. Customer Feedback is Late: Customers and stakeholders do not see the product until it is fully developed, which means feedback comes late in the process. This can result in a product that does not fully meet user needs or expectations.
         4. Risk of Obsolescence: Due to the lengthy development process, there is a risk that by the time the product is delivered, some of its features may be obsolete, or market conditions may have changed.
